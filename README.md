```

3. **Environment Configuration**:
Create a `.env` file with:
```
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

4. **Database Setup**:

```

5. **Load Sample Data**:
```bash
python manage.py populate_sample_data
```

6. **Run Development Server**:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/api/`

### Admin Panel
Access the admin panel at `http://localhost:8000/admin/`
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

## üìä Database Models

### Core Models
- **Category**: Radio station categories (Agriculture, News, Music, etc.)
- **RadioStation**: Radio station information with streaming URLs
- **UserProfile**: Extended user profiles with favorites and preferences
- **Event**: Scheduled radio events and shows
- **BlogPost**: Content management for articles and news
- **ListeningHistory**: User listening session tracking
- **Contact**: Contact form submissions

### Key Features
- **Automatic timestamps** on all models
- **Soft delete** capabilities where appropriate
- **Rich metadata** for better organization
- **Optimized queries** with select_related and prefetch_related

## üîß Configuration

### Settings Overview
- **REST Framework**: Configured with pagination and authentication
- **CORS**: Enabled for frontend integration
- **Media Files**: Configured for image uploads
- **Database**: SQLite for development (easily configurable for production)

### Environment Variables
- `SECRET_KEY`: Django secret key
- `DEBUG`: Debug mode (True/False)
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Comma-separated list of allowed hosts

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python manage.py test
```

The test suite includes:
- Model tests for data integrity
- API endpoint tests
- Authentication tests
- Business logic tests

## üì± Frontend Integration

This backend is designed to work with various frontend frameworks:
- **React/Next.js**: Full SPA support with REST API
- **Vue.js**: Compatible with Vuex for state management
- **Mobile Apps**: React Native, Flutter, or native apps
- **Web Components**: Can be integrated with any modern web framework

### CORS Configuration
CORS is pre-configured for common development ports:
- `http://localhost:3000` (React default)
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Environment Setup
1. Set `DEBUG=False` in production
2. Configure proper `SECRET_KEY`
3. Set up production database (PostgreSQL recommended)
4. Configure static file serving
5. Set up media file storage (AWS S3, etc.)

### Security Considerations
- Use HTTPS in production
- Configure proper CORS origins
- Set up rate limiting
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Regular security updates

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
- Indexes on frequently queried fields
- Optimized querysets with select_related/prefetch_related
- Database connection pooling for production

### Caching Strategy
- Redis for session storage and caching
- Cache frequently accessed data
- API response caching for static content
